# Optimizing Inventory Management and Business Processes for Sustainable Growth in a Manufacturing SME

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the complete **BDM Capstone Project** submitted as part of the **IIT Madras Online BS Degree Program**.  
The project focuses on **analyzing and optimizing inventory management, procurement, and working capital utilization** for a real-world manufacturing SME using data-driven methods.

The study is based on **primary business data** collected directly from a B2B packaged drinking water manufacturer and demonstrates how analytical techniques can significantly improve operational efficiency and cash flow.

## 🏭 Business Context
- **Company Type:** Manufacturing SME  
- **Industry:** B2B Packaged Drinking Water  
- **Brand:** Cubic  
- **Location:** Jaipur, Rajasthan  
- **Operational Period Analyzed:** April 2022 – March 2025  

Despite strong revenue growth, the firm faced:
- Overstocking and stockouts  
- High working capital locked in inventory  
- Manual, non-scalable inventory processes  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statements
1. **Inefficient Inventory Management**
   - Misalignment between sales, procurement, and production
   - Inventory buildup during low-demand periods

2. **Working Capital & Cash Flow Gaps**
   - Excess capital locked in raw materials and finished goods

3. **Lack of Automation & Scalability**
   - Manual tracking preventing real-time decision-making

## 📊 Dataset Description
The analysis uses **primary operational data** across four datasets:

| Dataset | Description |
|------|------------|
| Sales | Monthly sales revenue (₹) |
| Purchases | Monthly procurement value (₹) |
| Raw Materials | Item-wise quantity, rate, and value |
| Inventory Movement | Manufactured, sold, and remaining stock |

- **Time Span:** 36 months  
- **Granularity:** Monthly  
- **Data Authenticity:** Collected directly from the business

## 🛠️ Methodology & Tools

### Analytical Methods

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Strong sales growth with high volatility**
- **Procurement more volatile than sales** (CV higher for purchases)
- **Procurement leads sales by ~1 month**, causing excess inventory
- **2 raw materials account for ~65% of inventory value** (ABC A-class)
- **Average inventory turnover:** ~7.8x  
- **~₹10.8 lakh working capital locked** in inventory

---

## 💡 Recommendations
- ABC-based **min–max inventory control** for high-value items
- **Forecast-aligned procurement and production**
- **Seasonally staggered purchasing** instead of bulk buying
- KPI dashboards for:
  - Inventory turnover
  - Days-in-Inventory (DII)
  - Sales–purchase gaps

---

## 🚀 Business Impact
If implemented, the recommendations can deliver:
- **20–30% reduction in excess inventory**
- **₹3–4 lakh working capital release**
- Improved procurement discipline
- Scalable, data-driven operations
